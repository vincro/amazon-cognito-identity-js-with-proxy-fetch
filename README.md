# Amazon Cognito Identity SDK for JavaScript with Proxy

# Introduction

When using amazon-cognito-identity-js I needed a way to inject a proy agent into the fetch call of the userpool client.

It was possible, because credentials was already being passed in as fetch options, but there needed ot be a small mode to allow for the agent property to also be passed on also.

Hence the need for this package.
